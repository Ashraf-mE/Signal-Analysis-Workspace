# FComm_Project
This is a Fundamentals of communication project work done in my 4th semester. It basically shows the analysis of the input sinusoidal signal such as it's message, carrier, modulated and demodualted signal in both frequency and time domain and also the signals respective properties such as bit rate error (BER), Noise figure, error signal, SNR and many more and the intresting part is it's completely a GUI and very easy to use.

# How the idea strike ?
This is a team project and the project was told to be on the topics which were taught in classes whether software(MATLAB) or hardware.
And since I had intrest in MATLAB, I proposed the idea to build a signal analysis workspace which would be a simplied one and our team also agreed to it. So that's the root for the idea.

# How to use/run our project ?

1. You need to have a decently new version of MATLAB maybe of year (2022 or 2023)
2. Then you go the command window and type "appdesigner". You can also find it in the matlab inbuilt apps.
3. Select the FComm_Project folder which you would be clonned from this repo.
4. Finally, run the "FrontPage" file, you will find a new window popped onto your screen and you are good to use it.

# Note:
It may not be perfect, we did whatever we can in a given limited time to our best. There might be some errors and I would love to add your contributions if you have any.
